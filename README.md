# Time Series Forecasting for Portfolio Management Optimization

## Overview

This project applies time series forecasting to enhance portfolio management strategies. 
By analyzing historical stock data from Tesla (TSLA), the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), and the
S&P 500 ETF (SPY), it provides data-driven recommendations for optimal asset allocation to maximize returns while minimizing risks.

## Project Objectives

**1. Trend Identification:** Discover price patterns in TSLA, BND, and SPY to support trend-based strategies.

**2. Volatility Analysis:** Evaluate the volatility of TSLA to manage risks.

**3. Asset Allocation Optimization:** Suggest optimal portfolio compositions based on forecasted performance.
## Methods
- Data Extraction & Preprocessing:**Collected and cleaned historical data using YFinance.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends, seasonality, and volatility.
- Modeling: Trained ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM models to forecast asset prices.
- Portfolio Optimization: Applied the covariance matrix to adjust asset weights for maximum risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio).

## Results

The projectâ€™s predictive models provide actionable insights for constructing a balanced portfolio, enabling improved decision-making for high-risk, stable, and diversified assets.
